This brief lesson talks about CORS which is a rule that says a backend API like the one we are building out can only receive requests from a user who's browser/app/whatever is on the same domain. So in our case we are running on localhost which is our home computer. CORS says that our API can only take requests from a frontend (Postman or Firefox, eg) that is also originating on localhost. 

We illustrated this by going to google.com, right clicking and selecting 'inspect' from the dropdown menue. from there we chose the 'console' tab in the GUI and entered the command 'fetch('http://localhost:8000/').then(res=> res.json()).then(console.log)' which is basically an http request to our API (notice the fetch url). this request failed because our origin was google.com (the domain firefox was accessing at that moment). now if we open a new browser an type our localhost url into the address bar and hit enter we will be taken to our app front end because our API considers our origin domain to be localhost in that instance.

So we need to fix this because for now we want users to be able to access our website from any domain. The solution is a module that comes with fastAPI called CORSMiddleware. You can see it being implemented in the latest version of main.py. We copy/pasted some code from fastAPI docs middleware page and now we are ready to grant requests from outside domains. Basically the code consists of us telling FastAPI the names of domains that we will accept or, in our case, simply accepting all domains ("*").
