so we've been setting things up for github and heroku. it's a bit confusing but i'll try to explain. so we installed git which essentially took all our relevant files for our app and packaged them in a folder that was ready to be "pushed" or uploaded to a repository on the internet which will allow us to view our code and all relevant files and folders that exist for it. I guess this helps other developers contribute and help with your project. But it also is how the code would eventually be deployed into production, that is, operating online and accessible to end users. So it's basically like the format and means for getting your code from your work station to actual implementation.

So the repository is on github.com which we now have an account on and our code has been pushed to our new repository. By the way, all of the actions to prepare and upload our code are done through the command prompt. All documentation and questions can be answered with a google search as well as using github resources, stack overflow etc. It's messy, I'll be honest because I don't totally grasp the big picture. But anytime I have a question or make a mistake, google has been a good friend.

Ok then there's this other thing called heroku and it's described as a cloud platform for implementing applications. So it takes us another step closer to pushing our app into production. As opposed to github which is more of a repository for developing the app, heroku is like a production phase tool. It will eventually get the app up and running for end users. Sort of like web hosting I think but way more involved.
