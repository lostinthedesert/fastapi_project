we've updated the postman settings for our test site so that the user doesn't have to manually paste their jwt token into the authorization
tab. To do this we used the 'tests' tab under our '/login' request (recall that's the path that returns the token to the user).
There you will find some 'snippets' and if you click the 'set environment variable it will prefill some code in the body of the test
tab. We have to fill in the blanks for 'variable_key' and 'variable value'. So the key is "JWT" and the value is 'pm.response.json().
access_token()' (access_token being the key value returned by the 'login()' function in auth.py). What that does is set a variable
"JWT" whose value is our access_token (which changes depending on each user login). 

Then we go to our http request paths in Postman and under tests, instead of pasting the entire token string we simply put '{{JWT}}'.
From now on, the user's unique token will be filled in to each path's authorization field and they will be authenticated automatically.
No need for the user to copy/paste anymore.

We also set up an environment. This allows us to separate the development and production versions of our site for testing purposes.
We also used it to make a variable of our local host's url ('{{URL}}') which we now use in each request's tab in place of the 
actual domain.
