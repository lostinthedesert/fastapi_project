We learned how to set up a foreign key using pgadmin. A foreign key is a column in one of your tables that references a column
in a different table. So the example here is having the id from 'users' be a column in 'posts'. This is an example of relational
databases.

We added a column to 'posts' just like we always do using pgadmin and we set it's data type the same as the 'users.id' type (integer).
Then under constraints, we select the foreign key tab. We name the key 'posts_users_fkey' (really not important what you name it)
and then we select the reference location of the user_id column. Then we specify some other properties like what action to take
if the foreign key is deleted. In our example we selected 'cascade' which means if a user was to be delted, that would result in their
posts also being deleted.

That's all!
